        <h1>About Me </h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jordy and I pursuing a degree in Web Development. I have always been involved with technology ever since I was little, so I decided to pursue a degree in it.
            However, there are so many fields you can specialize in. It took me several years to find out what I wanted to accomplish until I discovered Web Development. 
            My first class was last summer at LBCC where I learned HTML/CSS. It was frustrating in the beginning because I couldnt always get the result that I was aiming for, but practice makes perfect.
            So far, I still enjoy working on it and hope to learn lots about Web Development. Eventually, I will be good enough call myself a Full Stack Web Developer and start changing lives. 
            As of recently, I created a <a href= https://github.com/jvjordy> Github Account</a> account. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think about it.
            
            Other then working on my future, I like to:
            <ul>
                        <li>Watch movies and TV shows</li>
                        <li>Spending time with friends and family</li>
                        <li>Travel to mountains, cities, foreign countries, national parks, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
        </p>
        
        <?php
        
        print "<p> 
        My favorite websites are <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/'>Youtube</a> and <a href= 'https://www.google.com/'> Google</a>. 
        I usually get lost while watching either educational or entertainment videos. Google is mostly used for research purposes and to discover new fun things to do because coding can be a pain.
        </p>";
        
        print "<p>
        This assignment is not exactly hard, but it is a little bit confusing because there is a lot of creating and connecting accounts to each other. 
        I got stuck a lot for many hours when I tried to make changes to my file and to update it afterwards to the other accounts. But it is actually easy, once you understand.
        </p>";
